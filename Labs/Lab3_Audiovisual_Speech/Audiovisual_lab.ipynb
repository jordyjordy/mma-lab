    "# 1 Audiovisual Speech Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Our goals today:\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will introduce you to the basics of automatic speech recognition using audio features only, image features only, and the combination of both features, i.e., audiovisual speech recognition. The speech recognition system is based on Hidden Markov Models. We will implement part of the training and decoding algorithm. You will train and test the automatic speech recognition system using the \"leave-one-out\" scheme. You will learn to understand the importance of audio, visual, and audiovisual features for speech recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Data <i class=\"fa fa-file\"></i>\n",
    "The data that you will use corresponds to 10 instances of the digit \"2\" being spoken and 10 instances of the digit \"5\" being spoken.\n",
    "The audio data consists of MFCC features and the visual data consists of lip tracking features. \n",
    "These features can be found in the data/ folder.\n",
    "Since there are not a lot of instances, there is no split of training and test data. In order to evaluate the performance of your speech recognizer you will be making use of cross validation, specifically the \"leave one out\" scheme, instead of a typical test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can read data/README.md for more details on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inspect the data. What does the data look like? Describe what the rows and columns represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compare the audio features and video features of the same instance. What is similar? What is different?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now take a look at other instances. What is similar? What is different?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Hidden Markov Model\n",
    "The method that you will use to develop your bi-modal speech recognizer is the Hidden Markov Model (HMM):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\n",
    "> The HMM is based on augmenting the Markov chain. A Markov chain is a model that  tells  us  something  about  the  probabilities  of  sequences  of  random  variables, states, each of which can take on values from some set. These sets can be words, or tags, or symbols representing anything, like the weather.  A Markov chain makes a very strong assumption that if we want to predict the future in the sequence, all that matters is the current state. The states before the current state have no impact on the future except via the current state. It’s as if to predict tomorrow’s weather you could examine today’s weather but you weren’t allowed to look at yesterday’s weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A Markov chain is useful when we need to compute a probability for a sequence of observable events. In many cases, however, the events we are interested in are hidden: we don’t observe them directly. For example we don’t normally observe speech units in an audio signal. Rather must infer the speech units from the sequence of audio. We call the speech units hidden because they are not observed. A hidden Markov model(HMM) allows us to talk about both observed events (like an audio sequence) and hidden events (like speech units) that we think of as causal factors in our probabilistic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An HMM $W = (A,B)$ is specified by the following components:\n",
    "* $Q=q_1q_2...q_N$ a set of $N$ states\n",
    "* $A=A_{11}...a_{ij}...a_{NN}$ a **transition probability matrix** $A$, each $a_{ij}$ representing the probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j$, s.t. $\\sum^N_{j=1}a_{ij}=1$  $\\forall i$\n",
    "* $O=o_1o_2...o_T$ a sequence of $T$ **observations**, each one drawn from a vocabulary $V=v_1,v_2,...,v_V$\n",
    "* $B=b_i(o_t)$ a sequence of **observation likelihoods**, also called **emission probabilities**, each expressing the probability of an obervation $o_t$ being generated from state $i$\n",
    "* $\\pi=\\pi_1,\\pi_2,...,\\pi_N$ an **initial probability distribution** over states. $\\pi_i$ being the probability that the Markov chain will start in state $i$. Some states $j$ may have $\\pi_j=0$, meaning that they cannot be initial states. Also, $\\sum^n_{i=1}pi_i=1$\n",

    "\\- Speech and Language Processing.  Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin. Chapter A.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on two of the fundamental HMM problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Given an observation sequence $O$ and the set of states in the HMM, learn the HMM probabilities $A$ and $B$, which will allow us to compute the class conditional probability $P(O|W)$, i.e., the acoustic model. In order to train the HMM acoustic models we will use a version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm called the Forward-Backward algorithm.\n",
    "*  Given an observation sequence $O$ consisting of a sequence of features (audio only, visual only, audio-visual), determine the best-matching digit $P(W|O)$. For testing, we use the Forward algorithm, which is very close to the Viterbi algorithm discussed in class, except that it does not take the max over the history but rather sums over the history.\n",
    "\n",
